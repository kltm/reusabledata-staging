  abstract    = "When we look at the rapid growth of scientific databases on
                 the Internet in the past decade, we tend to take the
                 accessibility and provenance of the data for granted. As we
                 see a future of increased database integration, the licensing
                 of the data may be a hurdle that hampers progress and
                 usability. We have formulated four rules for licensing data
                 for open drug discovery, which we propose as a starting point
                 for consideration by databases and for their ultimate
                 adoption. This work could also be extended to the
                 computational models derived from such data. We suggest that
                 scientists in the future will need to consider data licensing
                 before they embark upon re-using such content in databases
                 they construct themselves.",

  abstract  = "Open source software licenses determine, from a legal point of
               view, under which conditions software can be integrated and
               redistributed. The reason why developers of a project adopt (or
               change) a license may depend on various factors, e.g., the need
               for ensuring compatibility with certain third-party components,
               the perspective towards redistribution or commercialization of
               the software, or the need for protecting against somebody else’s
               commercial usage of the software. This paper reports a large
               empirical study aimed at quantitatively and qualitatively
               investigating when and why developers adopt or change software
               licenses. Specifically, we first identify license changes in
               1,731,828 commits, representing the entire history of 16,221
               Java projects hosted on GitHub. Then, to understand the
               rationale of license changes, we perform a qualitative analysis
               on 1,160 projects written in seven different programming
               languages, namely C, C++, C\#, Java, Javascript, Python, and
               Ruby---following an open coding approach inspired by grounded
               theory---on commit messages and issue tracker discussions
               concerning licensing topics, and whenever possible, try to build
               traceability links between discussions and changes. On one hand,
               our results highlight how, in different contexts, license
               adoption or changes can be triggered by various reasons. On the
               other hand, the results also highlight a lack of traceability of
               when and why licensing changes are made. This can be a major
               concern, because a change in the license of a system can
               negatively impact those that reuse it. In conclusion, results of
               the study trigger the need for better tool support in guiding
               developers in choosing/changing licenses and in keeping track of
               the rationale of license changes.",

  abstract = "Without software, modern research would not be possible.
              Understandably, people tend to marvel at results rather than the
              tools used in their discovery, which means the fundamental role
              of software in research has been largely overlooked. But whether
              it is widely recognised or not, research is inexorably connected
              to the software that is used to generate results, and if we
              continue to overlook software we put at risk the reliability and
              reproducibility of the research itself. The adoption of software
              is accompanied by new risks - many of which are unknown to the
              majority of the research community. The practices of software
              sustainability minimise these risks and help to increase trust in
              research results, increase the rate of discovery, increase return
              on investment and ensure that research data remains readable and
              usable for longer. Funders are well aligned with the goals of
              software sustainability: both seek to support reliable, trusted
              research. This means that funders are well placed to play a
              pivotal role in advocating software sustainability. Funders can
              help raise awareness, and can make some simple, low-cost changes,
              such as encouraging the adoption of software management plans,
              that could lead to significant improvements in the software used
              in research. Improving software sustainability requires a number
              of changes: some technical and others societal, some small and
              others significant. We must start by raising awareness of
              researchers’ reliance on software. This goal will become easier
              if we recognise the valuable contribution that software makes to
              research - and reward those people who invest their time into
              developing reliable and reproducible software. We must educate
              the research community on the issues raised by software adoption,
              and provide training in the software engineering skills that are
              needed to overcome them. We cannot rely on researchers to adopt
              all of the skills needed for software sustainability, we must
              also allow research groups to recruit software experts, and we
              must create organisations that develop and disseminate expertise
              in software sustainability. The adoption of software has led to
              significant advances in research. But if we do not change our
              research practices, the continued rise in software use will be
              accompanied by a rise in retractions. Ultimately, anyone who is
              concerned about the reliability and reproducibility of research
              should be concerned about software sustainability. This argument
              alone may rely too much on the stick and not enough on the
              carrot. To that end, we must also show",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: There is wide agreement in the biomedical research
                 community that research data sharing is a primary ingredient
                 for ensuring that science is more transparent and
                 reproducible. Publishers could play an important role in
                 facilitating and enforcing data sharing; however, many
                 journals have not yet implemented data sharing policies and
                 the requirements vary widely across journals. This study set
                 out to analyze the pervasiveness and quality of data sharing
                 policies in the biomedical literature. METHODS: The online
                 author's instructions and editorial policies for 318
                 biomedical journals were manually reviewed to analyze the
                 journal's data sharing requirements and characteristics. The
                 data sharing policies were ranked using a rubric to determine
                 if data sharing was required, recommended, required only for
                 omics data, or not addressed at all. The data sharing method
                 and licensing recommendations were examined, as well any
                 mention of reproducibility or similar concepts. The data was
                 analyzed for patterns relating to publishing volume, Journal
                 Impact Factor, and the publishing model (open access or
                 subscription) of each journal. RESULTS: A total of 11.9\% of
                 journals analyzed explicitly stated that data sharing was
                 required as a condition of publication. A total of 9.1\% of
                 journals required data sharing, but did not state that it
                 would affect publication decisions. 23.3\% of journals had a
                 statement encouraging authors to share their data but did not
                 require it. A total of 9.1\% of journals mentioned data
                 sharing indirectly, and only 14.8\% addressed protein,
                 proteomic, and/or genomic data sharing. There was no mention
                 of data sharing in 31.8\% of journals. Impact factors were
                 significantly higher for journals with the strongest data
                 sharing policies compared to all other data sharing criteria.
                 Open access journals were not more likely to require data
                 sharing than subscription journals. DISCUSSION: Our study
                 confirmed earlier investigations which observed that only a
                 minority of biomedical journals require data sharing, and a
                 significant association between higher Impact Factors and
                 journals with a data sharing requirement. Moreover, while
                 65.7\% of the journals in our study that required data sharing
                 addressed the concept of reproducibility, as with earlier
                 investigations, we found that most data sharing policies did
                 not provide specific guidance on the practices that ensure
                 data is maximally available and reusable.",

  abstract    = "In many disciplines, data are highly decentralized across
                 thousands of online databases (repositories, registries, and
                 knowledgebases). Wringing value from such databases depends on
                 the discipline of data science and on the humble bricks and
                 mortar that make integration possible; identifiers are a core
                 component of this integration infrastructure. Drawing on our
                 experience and on work by other groups, we outline 10 lessons
                 we have learned about the identifier qualities and best
                 practices that facilitate large-scale data integration.
                 Specifically, we propose actions that identifier practitioners
                 (database providers) should take in the design, provision and
                 reuse of identifiers. We also outline the important
                 considerations for those referencing identifiers in various
                 circumstances, including by authors and data generators. While
                 the importance and relevance of each lesson will vary by
                 context, there is a need for increased awareness about how to
                 avoid and manage common identifier problems, especially those
                 related to persistence and web-accessibility/resolvability. We
                 focus strongly on web-based identifiers in the life sciences;

                 news stories and there exist numerous initiatives to help
                 address this problem. We posit that a contributor is simply a
                 lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate
                 research reproducibility. In particular, the inability to
                 uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and
                 model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce
                 experiments even where the science is otherwise sound. In
                 order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we
                 designed an experiment to ascertain the ``identifiability'' of
                 research resources in the biomedical literature. We evaluated
                 recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience,
                 Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology
                 and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of
                 impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental
                 method reporting guidelines. We attempted to uniquely identify
                 model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast),
                 antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi),
                 constructs, and cell lines. Specific criteria were developed
                 to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and
                 included examining relevant repositories (such as model
                 organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as
                 vendor sites. The results of this experiment show that 54\% of
                 resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications,
                 regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting
                 requirements. For example, in many cases the organism strain
                 in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was
                 used could not be identified. Our results show that
                 identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility.
                 Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors,
                 reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers.
                 Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a
                 research-wide improvement of this substantial problem in

                 through the efforts of the Mouse Genome Informatics group and
                 the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. In this
                 review, we highlight the challenges in comparing human
                 clinical phenotypes with mouse phenotypes and some of the
                 solutions that have been developed by members of the Monarch
                 Initiative. These tools allow the identification of mouse
                 models for known disease-gene associations that may otherwise
                 have been overlooked as well as candidate genes may be
                 prioritized for novel associations. The culmination of these
                 efforts is the Exomiser software package that allows clinical
                 researchers to analyse patient exomes in the context of
                 variant frequency and predicted pathogenicity as well the
                 phenotypic similarity of the patient to any given candidate
                 orthologous gene.",
