# License types for the (Re)usable Data Project

The exact boundries of various license types is still in flux within the (Re)usable Data Project, and will no doubt be revisited as we better understand the space our communities work in. At its core, we're wanting to examine pools of (re)use--where things can be mixed and where they must stay separate.

The basic idea is that "our" "permissive" licenses can all inter-operate for our range of (re)use. The `copyleft` (and `closedpool`) licenses would also theoretically all inter-operation for our use, assuming that everybody all used the same one or had compatible ones, which is a practical non-starter in many domains.

Eventually, we would would like to use more granular terms, essentially a license compatibility ontology, so that a new resources could intelligently knit together what they need with their license, so on. This is just a humble first pass to get the most basic understanding.

## <span id="publicdomain">public domain</span>

While a public domain declaration may work well in some jurisdictions, international portability makes it problematic for our purposes. This does not include CC0.

## <span id="permissive">permissive</span>

A "permissive" license is one that allows reuse in modifying, remixing, and sharing with non-onerous restriction. This category would include CC0 and CC BY 4.0.

## <span id="copyleft">copyleft</span>

While the license is very open to use, it's reuse requires a matching open license for reuse. This category includes GPLs and CC BY SA 4.0.

## <span id="closedpool">closed pool</span>

Similar to copyleft, but without the public "open" component; think of a private data pool that members can enjoy if they join.

## <span id="restrictive">restrictive</span>

A "restrictive" license is one that may offer more freedoms than the standard US copyright, but is of little use to allowing reasonably flexible (re)use. This category includes CC BY ND 4.0.

## <span id="copyright">copyright</span>

This is the standard restrictive default copyright in the US. Within our documentation, we may also refer to this as "ARR" or "all rights reserved".

## <span id="unknown">unknown</span>

For this category, the license could not be found for analysis or the terms of the license are so exotic that no analysis can reasonably be done.
