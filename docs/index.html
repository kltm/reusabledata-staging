		The initial driving concern of this project is the use
		and reuse of biological and biomedical data. However,
		this is a general problem in the scientific community
		and needs to be addressed directly. <br /> For each
		resource, using
		our <a href="criteria.html">criteria</a>, we attempt
		to objectively assign zero to five stars for how well
		we believe a resource's data may build upon, edited,
		modified, and redistributed. <br /> Grossly speaking:
		
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<ul class="nicer-ul">
		  <li>
		    <strong>5 stars</strong>&nbsp;<span style="color:#ffd700;font-size:1.0em">&#x2605&nbsp;&#x2605&nbsp;&#x2605&nbsp;&#x2605&nbsp;&#x2605</span><br />
		    The license unambiguously allows the unfettered (re)use
		    and redistribution of the data.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <strong>4 stars</strong>&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;</span><br />

		    The license unambiguously allows (re)use and
		    redistribution of the data under some terms.
		  </li>
		  <li>
		    <strong>3 stars</strong>&nbsp;<span style="color:orange;">&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;</span><br />

		    The license is clearly stated, unambiguous, and of
		    a standard type, and has clear access, but has
		    terms that may greatly impact the (re)use and
		    redistribution of the data.

		  <li>
		    <strong>2.5 or less stars</strong>&nbsp;<span style="color:red;">&#x2605;&nbsp;&#x2605;</span>&nbsp;&#x00bd;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&#x2205;<br />

		    There are likely issues in definitively finding
		    the license, ambiguities in the license that
		    hamper further analysis, issues with clean data
		    access, or terms that require legal advice.
		  </li>
		</ul>

		We are not lawyers and this is not legal advice: all
		institutions and groups have their own perspectives
		and counsel. We are a group of scientists, engineers,
		and specialists that are concerned about the use and
		reuse of increasingly interconnected, derived, and
		reprocessed data. We want to make sure that
		data-driven scientific endeavors can work with one
		another in meaningful ways without undue legal
		concerns.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		What we want is to do with the Reusable Data Project
		is provide a resource looking at some of the possible
		issues around the reuse of scientific data and open a
		conversation about how to deal with them.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		We also want to actively work with the community in
		considering our criteria and in making sure that our
		information about scientific data resources is
		up-to-date and correct. If you have any questions,
		concerns, or see any problems, please open a ticket on
		our <a href="https://github.com/reusabledata/reusabledata/issues">GitHub
