    What this is

    Why this is important

    Who we are
    We are not lawyers, this is not legal advice: all institutions and groups
    have their own perspectives and counsel.
    We are a group of scientists,
    engineers, and specialists that are concerned about the use and reuse
    of increasingly interconnected, derived, and reprocessed data. 

    What we want to provide a resource 
    looking at some of the possible issues are the reuse of scientific data.

    If you see an issue, please open a ticket on our github tracker here:
    http://github.com/reusabledata/reusabledata
    
    We want to actively engage the community in conversation and make
    sure that our information about scientific data is up-to-date and
    correct. If you have any questions or see any problems, please open
    a ticket on our tracker.

    Even more about us.
    The initial driving concern of this project is the use and reuse
    of biological and biomedical data 
    However, this is a general problem in the scientific community and needs
    to be addressed directly.

    For each resource, we assign one of 
    we attempt to assign these values objectively by meeting our criteria for
    reusable data
    green + gold star - the license unambiguously allows the /free/
     reuse and redistribution of the data
    green - the license unambiguously allows reuse and redistribution
     of the data under some terms
    yellow - the license is ambiguous or has terms that prevents the reuse and
     redistribution of in some cases
    red - the license could not be found (so assumed to be
     under standard copyright) or the license unambiguously makes clear that
     reuse and redistribution is not welcome for the general community 

    If you see any problems with our determinations or would like to
    make corrections or clarifications, please open a ticket for us on our 
    issue tracker.

    Criteria:
    * Clearly stated
      Have a clearly stated license for data use.  If
      there is no license, then rights are unclear and one needs to
      assume the default: all rights reserved
      (e.g. https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html).
    * Allow use and reuse
      Data that cannot be used in not data at all. In modern
      data-driven science, the ability to synthesize data and make the
      results available for others to do the same is paramount.
    * Non-discriminatory
      Ideally, data should be able to be used and reused by anybody for
      any purpose, academic, commercial, and anything else.
      A counterexample may be 
    * Non-revocable
      Of course somebody might choose to close there data off in the future,
      but there should be no language that revokes usage rights retroactively
      for the data before that horizon.
    * Freely and openly available
      (GOLD) The data should should be to all people for any
      purpose. An example of this would be data explicitly released
      under the Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution 4.0 International
      license https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
      
    Inspired by the efforts of scientists around the world and the
    game changing efforts of projects like the Creative Commons,
    Wikimedia Foundation, and the Free Software movement (e.g. Debian
    and the FSF),
    
    We hope to engage the larger community in an open and fruitful
    discussion on issues concerning the use and reuse of scientific
    data, including the balance of openness and how to make ends meet
    in an increasingly competitive environment.

    If you would like to join our efforts to highlight the use and
    reuse of data in the sciences, please feel free to contact us on
    our tracker TODO or create a pull request against our repository
    at TODO.
