### Background

The (Re)usable Data Project and reusabledata.org was developed as part
of the NCATS Biomedical Data Translator and the Monarch Initiative,
where the reuse and free redistribution of publicly available data for
disease discovery was burdensome. The (Re)usable Data Project was
created to help others navigate the legal synthesis and redistribution
of public data and to help data providers make it easier for others to
use and reuse their data.

We are grateful to the many original sources of our data for allowing
their integration.
