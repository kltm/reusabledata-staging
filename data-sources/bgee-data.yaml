    - 'They do not seem to me looking at the remix affects of licenses of their own data (http://bgee.org/?page=source).'

license-issues:
    - {criteria: A.1.2, comment: 'After some search we were unable to determine the license of the non-ontology portions of the BGee data. No explicit license statements were apparent, causing a cascade of criteria violations. In spite of this, access itself is clear, so one star is awarded accordingly for C.'}
