description: 'The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is generating a knockout mouse strain for every protein coding gene by using the embryonic stem cell resource generated by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC). Systematic broad-based phenotyping is performed by each IMPC center using standardized procedures found within the International Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screens (IMPReSS) resource. Gene-to-phenotype associations are made by a versioned statistical analysis.'
