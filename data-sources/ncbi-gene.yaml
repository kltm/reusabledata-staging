license-issues:
    - criteria: A.2
      comment: The license apparently uses language to declare something similar to "public domain", but with the caveat that it may contain data that is otherwise.
    - criteria: B.1
      comment: This is judged to be a violation as any (re)use would depend on negotiating with all upstream copyright holders, which are not presented.
    - criteria: B.2.1
      comment: It is implied that their license does not cover all data.
    - criteria: B.2.2
      comment: Could not find an explicit "clean" version of the data in the downloads.
    - criteria: D.1.2
      comment: There is no apparent way to guarantee usage without possibly violating copyright.
    - criteria: E.1.2
      comment: There is no apparent way to guarantee usage without possibly violating copyright.
license-commentary:
  - 'We specifically avoided the more general operation of the EUtils suite, focusing on the provided downloads.'
  - 'The following statements from the license page seem to support a custom "hands off" approach. To was difficult to decide if this was "restrictive" or "unknown.'
  - '...NCBI itself places no restrictions on the use or distribution of the data contained therein. Nor do we accept data when the submitter has requested restrictions on reuse or redistribution...'
  - '...some submitters of the original data...may claim patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights in all or a portion of the data (that has been submitted)...'
  - '...NCBI cannot provide comment or unrestricted permission concerning the use, copying, or distribution of the information contained in the molecular databases...'
