license-commentary:
  - 'The data seems to include a large amount of identifiable and is controlled as such.'
  - There also exists unrestricted data and the thus the NIG GDS data use policy is two-tiered.
  - Controlled-access policy 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99227/'
  - General data sharing information (see data sharing policy section) 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5296/'
  - NIH GDS policy tone and language seems non-uniform and more like case-by-case.
  - Example GTex project submitted policy 'https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?view_pdf&stacc=phs000424.v1.p1'
  - NIH GDS states 'NIH expects investigators and their institutions to provide basic plans for following this Policy' however we assume the burden stays with data re-reuser to contact source with questions and issues should they arise effecting criteria B.
  - Regarding institutional affiliation 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45308/'
  - A.2: unknown license type due to 'The terms and conditions of using dbGaP data vary by study'.
  - B.1: Negotation needed for controlled- access data and license type or terms and conditions unknown. .
  - B.2.2: Scoping is incomplete as license type or terms and conditions unknown.
  - D.1.2: Because the terms and conditions vary by study, cannot comment on downstream reuse/remix.
  - E.1.1: Language in the NIH GDS policy may be interpreted by non-legal professional that the contents may be reused by researchers (at NIH or with Institutional affiliation).
