    - Fails A.1 b/c has multiple licenses (which are kind of hard to find). Passes(?) A.2: Maybe has a “Standard license”? Has a “copyright”
    - Fails B.1 - needs negotiation. Passes B.2
    - Pass C.1, maybe pass C.2?  The access process is documented, but seems very complicated & you have to $$ for it (which doesn’t seem “reasonable” to me)
    - Passes D.1.1 - certain use is forbidden, but academic can (re)use data
    - Passes E.1.1 - certain groups are forbidden, but academic can (re)use data
